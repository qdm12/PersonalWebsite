# PersonalWebsite

## HTML Webpage
My HTML-based main personal website is accessible at [https://qdm12.github.io/PersonalWebsite](https://qdm12.github.io/PersonalWebsite)

[![Desktop website](images/website_desktop.jpg)](https://qdm12.github.io/PersonalWebsite)

It uses:
- [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/examples/) for icons such as the ones on the static left toolbar
- The [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) 3D library for the fog background
- The [Particles.js](https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js/) library to create the interconnecting particles background
- The rest is coded from scratch

What has to be done:
- Finish up the projects section
- Fix the clouds background
- Accelerate loading, with asynchronous JS loads
- Add an iframe of Quora or a sort of live feed
- Add an iframe or similar to show my activity on Github
- Create a mobile version of the website, especially with way less load
- Make something with the blockchain (i.e. Quentin loves Bitcoin)
- Add more of those fancy backgrounds for the desktop version, with [http://particle-love.com/](http://particle-love.com/)

## Markdown webpage
My Markdown-based personal website is accessible at [https://github.com/qdm12/PersonalWebsite/blob/master/markdown/readme.md](https://github.com/qdm12/PersonalWebsite/blob/master/markdown/readme.md)

- This is a simpler yet more complete presentation of myself
- It contains low resolution pictures and all the links you would need to see what I've done so far
- It is more often updated than my website as it is easier to maintain
- It also works very well on mobile devices
