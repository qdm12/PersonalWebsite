#### Year group project: *Wasteless*
- Leader of a team of 7 students
- Goal was to develop an ecosystem to reduce the waste of expired food
    - Notify a user on his/her smartphone about food products nearly expired
    - Propose him to share it with neighbours if he can't eat it
    - Establish a network of "food friends" with reputation points, messaging and so on
- This involved several technologies and developments
    - At the supermarket's level, barcodes were replaced by low-cost RFID chips (contactless) which contain the expiry date of the product in addition to the barcode data. This also allowed a faster checkout of the supermarket's consumer.
    - At the consumer's level, an Android application was developed.
    - A program for the cashier at the supermarket and a server were developed, to communicate information on all the goods bought for each user and to handle the food social network.
    - A website was also designed for non-mobile users of Wasteless.
- The final state of the group project was actually promising and we obtained surprisingly high marks.

I have obtained 57.43% overall
