      (contactless) containing the expiry date of the product in addition to 
      the barcode data. This also allowed a faster checkout for the customer.
    - At the customer level, an Android application was developed :iphone:
    - A C++ based server was developed to communicate information on all the goods bought by each user and to handle the food social network.
    - A C++ client program for the cashier at the supermarket was developed.
    - A website was also designed for non-mobile users of Wasteless.
- The final state of the group project was actually promising and we obtained surprisingly high marks :simple_smile:
